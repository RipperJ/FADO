Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

Edge with Location Constraints  
Static Logic contains edges with location constraints that may impact implementation results.  It is best to create an EXCLUDE_PLACEMENT static pblock to cover the edge which prevents unnecessary logic from getting placed in narrow gap.  TAG='53_RE_S_RP1'.

Narrow Gap with Location Constraints  
RP pblock 'pblock_dynamic_region' contains a narrow gap with location constraints that may impact implementation results.  If possible, it is best to avoid gaps within a RP. If that cannot be done, it is best to PROHIBIT the CLBs inside the gap to avoid congestion.  If additional logic is needed nearby, instead add a static EXCLUDE_PLACEMENT pblock that covers the gap and add only essential logic to this pblock.  TAG='55_G79_RP1_S'.

Gap with Location Constraints  
RP pblock 'pblock_dynamic_region' contains a gap with location constraints that likely will impact implementation results.  If possible, it is best to avoid gaps within an RP.

It is strongly suggested to change this mode to NO_CHANGE for best power characteristics. However, both WRITE_FIRST and NO_CHANGE may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design.

REQP-1858#16 Advisory
RAMB36E2_writefirst_collision_advisory  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (pfm_top_i/static_region/slr1/pcie/inst/pcie_4_0_pipe_inst/pcie_4_0_bram_inst/bram_post_inst/bram_16k_int/ECC_RAM.RAMB36E2[3].ramb36e2_inst) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. It is strongly suggested to change this mode to NO_CHANGE for best power characteristics. However, both WRITE_FIRST and NO_CHANGE may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
