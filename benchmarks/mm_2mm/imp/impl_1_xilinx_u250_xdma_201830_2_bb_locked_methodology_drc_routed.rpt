TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock pfm_top_i/static_region/slr1/jtag_fallback/inst/bs_switch/inst/BSCAN_SWITCH.N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_inst/SERIES7_BSCAN.bscan_inst/TCK is created on an inappropriate pin pfm_top_i/static_region/slr1/jtag_fallback/inst/bs_switch/inst/BSCAN_SWITCH.N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_inst/SERIES7_BSCAN.bscan_inst/TCK.
